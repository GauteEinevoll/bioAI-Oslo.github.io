My name is Mikkel Lepper√∏d and I work as a Research Scientist at [Simula Research Laboratory](https://www.simula.no/people/mikkel) where I am currently leading a group called [bioAI](https://bioai-oslo.github.io/) in the department for [Scientific Computing](https://www.simula.no/research/research-areas/scientific-computing). I previously worked with biologically inspired artificial intelligence (AI) as a Postdoc at the University of Oslo (UiO), Norway, and before that I obtained a PhD in Neuroscience at UiO and a Master's in Applied Mathematics at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences.
